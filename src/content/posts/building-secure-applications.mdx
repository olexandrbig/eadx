## Security as a Foundation

Too often, security gets bolted on at the end of a project. By then, the cost of fixing vulnerabilities is orders of magnitude higher than addressing them during design.

## Our Approach

At EADX, security is embedded into every layer:

- **Transport layer** — HSTS headers enforce encrypted connections from the first request
- **Content policy** — strict CSP rules prevent cross-site scripting and data injection
- **Frame protection** — X-Frame-Options blocks clickjacking attempts
- **Permission boundaries** — browser APIs like camera and geolocation are denied by default

## Modern Frameworks Help

Frameworks like Next.js provide built-in protections: automatic escaping in JSX, secure headers configuration, and server-side rendering that reduces client-side attack surface.

## The Takeaway

Security doesn't have to slow you down. With the right tools and mindset, it becomes a natural part of shipping quality software.
