## Evaluating Options

When building a new platform, the framework choice sets the tone for everything that follows. We evaluated several options before landing on Next.js 16.

## What Stood Out

### Server Components by Default

React Server Components let us render on the server without shipping JavaScript to the client. This means faster page loads and better SEO out of the box.

### Static Generation

Our blog posts are compiled at build time. No database queries, no API calls at runtime — just fast, pre-rendered HTML served from the edge.

### Built-in Optimizations

Image optimization, font loading, code splitting — Next.js handles the performance basics so we can focus on building features.

## Minimal Dependencies

We deliberately kept our dependency count low. Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and MDX — that's the core. Every additional package is a maintenance burden and a potential security risk.

## Looking Ahead

As the platform grows, Next.js gives us room to scale — from static pages to dynamic server-rendered routes, API endpoints, and middleware — all within the same framework.
