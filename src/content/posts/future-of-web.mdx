## A New Era for the Web

The web platform is evolving faster than ever. Server components, edge computing, and modern tooling are changing how we think about building applications.

## Key Trends

### Server-First Architecture

The pendulum is swinging back toward the server. With React Server Components and streaming, we can deliver faster initial loads while keeping the interactivity users expect.

### TypeScript Everywhere

Type safety has become the standard, not the exception. From API contracts to database schemas, TypeScript ensures reliability across the entire stack.

### CSS Renaissance

Modern CSS has matured dramatically. Container queries, cascade layers, and native nesting reduce our dependence on tooling while increasing expressiveness.

## Our Stack

We chose our tools deliberately:

1. **Next.js** for its server-first architecture and zero-config deployment
2. **TypeScript** for end-to-end type safety
3. **Tailwind CSS** for rapid, consistent styling without context-switching
4. **MDX** for content that blends prose with interactive components

## Looking Forward

The web is becoming more capable every day. Our job is to harness these capabilities responsibly — building fast, accessible, and secure experiences for everyone.
